The following CSS code snippet exhibits an unusual behavior related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is unexpectedly overridden */
}

div p:first-of-type {
  color: purple; /* This is applied correctly */
}
```

The unexpected behavior is that the `div p` selector doesn't seem to be properly overriding the `div` selector. The `color: green` declaration is ignored. However, if a pseudo-class like `:first-of-type` is added to the selector, the specificity changes and the rule applies correctly.
