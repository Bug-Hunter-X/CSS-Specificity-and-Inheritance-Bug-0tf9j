The issue stems from the fact that the `color: blue` declaration in the `div` selector is more specific than the `color: green` declaration in the `div p` selector. This is because the `div p` selector has a specificity of 0,1,0 (one type selector), while the `div` selector has a specificity of 0,1,0 (one type selector). In this scenario, the last encountered declaration wins.

To solve this, we can use the `!important` flag to override the specificity.

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* Now this overrides */
}

div p:first-of-type {
  color: purple; /* This is applied correctly */
}
```

Alternatively, increase specificity of `div p` selector.

```css
div p {
  color: green; /* Now this overrides */
}
```
